# James: 5 Manifesto
We confess: **Christ is Lord, not Capital.**  
We resist: exploitative wealth and systems that crush workers and the poor.  
We proclaim: God hears the harvesters’ cries.  
We practice: repentance, generosity, solidarity, and good news to the poor.  
We invite: churches, workers, and neighbors to follow Jesus in public—toward mercy, equity, and hope.
