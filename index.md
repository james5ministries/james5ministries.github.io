## Who We Are
James: 5 Ministries is a grassroots, Christ-centered movement calling the Church to confront economic injustice. We listen to the harvesters’ cries (James 5:4) and answer with faithful action.

- **Christ is Lord** — Our allegiance is to Jesus, not Mammon.  
- **Justice is Discipleship** — Faith without works is dead.  
- **God Hears the Poor** — We stand with workers and the oppressed.

> *“The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord.”* — **James 5:4**
